CloudBees Eclipse Toolkit

CloudBees Eclipse Toolkit provides developer access to various CloudBees services:
 * Jenkins instances

== Setting up the development environment == 

1. Download Eclipse 4.4 or 4.5 SDK
Set it as Target Platform

2. We maintain compatibility for Java 7 and Java 8 so configure Installed JREs to have JDK 7 set default.

3. Make sure to load cb_cleanup.xml and cb_format.xml to your eclipse formatting and cleanup settings to keep the project consistent!
