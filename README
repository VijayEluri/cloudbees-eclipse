CloudBees Eclipse Toolkit

CloudBees Eclipse Toolkit provides developer access to various CloudBees services:
 * Forge source repositories (supported Git and SVN)
 * HaaS instances
 * Nectar instances

== Setting up the development environment == 

1. Download Eclipse 3.6.1 SDK from http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.6.1-201009090800/index.php
Set it as Target Platform

2. We maintain compatibility for Java 5 so configure Installed JREs to have JDK 1.5 set default.

3. Make sure to load cb_cleanup.xml and cb_format.xml to your eclipse formatting and cleanup settings to keep the project consistent!
