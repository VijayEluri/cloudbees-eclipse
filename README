CloudBees Eclipse Toolkit

CloudBees Eclipse Toolkit provides developer access to various CloudBees services:
 * Forge source repositories (supported Git and SVN)
 * JaaS instances
 * Jenkins/Hudson instances

== Setting up the development environment == 

1. Download Eclipse 3.6.1 SDK from http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.6.1-201009090800/index.php
Set it as Target Platform

2. We maintain compatibility for Java 5 so configure Installed JREs to have JDK 1.5 set default.

3. Make sure to load cb_cleanup.xml and cb_format.xml to your eclipse formatting and cleanup settings to keep the project consistent!

4. Install eGit from Helios - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios preconfigured update site

5. Install subclipse from http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x
OR
5. Install subversive/SVN from Helios update site 

Please do not use subclipse and eclipse.org subversive/SVN client at the same time. 
They don't work well together and are not designed to do so.
